# Kickstarter Analysis


## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this analysis was to reveal the outcomes of several kickstarter campaigns based on their monetary goals and what date the campaign was launched. Our hypothetical client was starting a theater play and wanted to see how other theater kickstarters performed and if there were any insights that would help her in her campaign.
  

## Analysis and Challenges
  To start my analysis, I created a pivot table on a seperate sheet titled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" that had months as rows, and the outcomes(successful, failed, canceled) as the columns. I then filtered it by the Parent Category set to theater so we can specifically see how well the theater campaigns performed based on the month that the kickstarter was launched. Below is an image that represents the Pivot Table.
